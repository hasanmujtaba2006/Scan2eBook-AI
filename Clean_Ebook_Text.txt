Other: Common Casting Defects:
- Defect: Cause and Explanation

- Casting solidifies too slowly due to low pouring temperature, slow pouring, or thin sections.

Misruns: These occur when two metal portions meet but do not fuse.

Cold Shuts: This happens when two metal portions meet but do not fuse, and gas bubbles are trapped in the cast.

Cold Shots: These are caused by molten metal splashing into the mold, or gas trapped in the mold/core, or mold/core shift.

Welding: Gas can cause penetration, or mold/core shift.
